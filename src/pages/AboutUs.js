// What We Do
// Metropol was established in Kenya in 1996 as a business Information and credit management company. In 2006 Metropol entered into the business space of providing credit rating services that enable corporates to raise capital and meet their financing needs.

// Metropol is also licensed by the Central Bank of Kenya to provide Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) Services to ALL banks in Kenya. Our CRB services leverage full-file credit information sharing and alternative data sources from MFIs, SACCOs, HELB, Utilities, Mobile phone companies and providers of goods and services on credit to help customers improve their access to finance and increase the credit providersâ€™ capacity to lend profitably to more customers.

// We support Credit providers in managing Credit Risk throughout the credit life cycle in order to increase efficiency and lower risk of default and thus maximize profit. At the same time, we provide the credit consumer with tools that will help negotiate favorable terms when applying and managing their credit. In that way, we provide a Total Customer Solution.
